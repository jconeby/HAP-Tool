# Installation Guide

Setting up Panacea is a straightforward process. For a hassle-free and quick setup, we recommend using XAMPP. Below are the step-by-step instructions to get your tool up and running:

## Prerequisites

- A machine running Windows.
- Internet connection to download necessary software.

## Using XAMPP

XAMPP provides an easy-to-install distribution containing Apache, MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. Here's how you can set up Panacea using XAMPP:

### 1. Download XAMPP

Download the XAMPP installer for your operating system from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

### 2. Install XAMPP

- **Windows**: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to select PHP and any other components you might need.

### 3. Start XAMPP
Run the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache server. Ensure Apache (and MySQL if you're using a database) services are running.

### 4. Deploy Panacea
Clone or download your tool from the GitHub repository.

Move the tool's files into XAMPP's `htdocs` directory:

- **Windows**: `C:\xampp\htdocs`

### 5. Create a Directory
Create a directory called panacea in `C:\xampp\htdocs\`

### 5. Access Panacea
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/panacea` to access the tool.

You're now ready to use Panacea! If you encounter any issues during installation, please refer to our [FAQ](link_to_faq) or [open an issue on GitHub](link_to_issues).
